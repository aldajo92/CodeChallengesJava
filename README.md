## Java concepts ##

### List, Set, Map ###

List in Java provides ordered and indexed collection which may contain duplicates. The Set interface provides an unordered collection of unique objects, i.e. Set doesn't allow duplicates, while Map provides a data structure based on key-value pair and hashing.

All three List, Set, and Map are interfaces in Java and there are many concrete implementations of them are available in Collection API. ArrayList and LinkedList are two most popular used List implementation while LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, and HashSet are frequently used Set implementation.
